# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of the project is to help Louise to understand different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
The objective was to identify the factors (i.e., revenue goals, the month of the year, and type of the theatre events) for the success of a play.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenge in the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: In the orientation of the table through Pivot table.
### Challenge in the analysis of Outcomes Based on goal: In configuring COUNTIFS() function. 



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on Launch Date?

Answer: (1) The most theater events were held 2015. It consisted of 430 total events. 
Approximately 75% of events of 2015 belonged to play. Among them, approximately 65% were successful.

(2) The most number of musical and spaces events of the theatre was also held in 2015. 
However, those theatre events were relatively unsuccessful (success rate < 50%). 

As such, it can be concluded that the success of 2015 relied on the success of theatre/plays.





- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Answer: The concluding remark is  -the success rate is inversely proportional to its goal. A higher goal has lower success and vice versa.




- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Answer: As per this dataset and the focus of the analysis, the success rate solely depends on the goal of revenue. It does not always happen. 
Other criteria could be important, such as performance, artists, weather, locations. Some of them were included in the dataset; however, they were not included in making a conclusion.
Additionally, it is unknown why some years were successful and others years were not. To understand these issues, we need different attributes. 




- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Answer:
1) A histogram to show how the success rate decreased with the increased goal.
2) A bar diagram to show the percentage of success, failure, and cancel rate with a goal.
3) A dot plot to show the successful events over the month of the years.
